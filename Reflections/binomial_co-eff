Basically there are two ways of getting this done
1.By recursive approach
2.By dynamic progrmming

  By reursive approach although the code is small but it is more time consuming,memory consuming because for every iteration new variabes created.
  
  By dynamic programming aproach each value is computed and stored in a table .Those values can be reused again which is again not possibe in recursive way
  
  Also , a variant of Dynamic programming is used where it uses 1D array to store values of ony those iterations that is asked .
  it can be used when we require particular bc and cannot obtain previous .
