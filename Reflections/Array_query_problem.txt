Array querying Techniques
1.Look up table:
   -> Time complexity for processing table O(n^2)
   -> Space complexity is O(n^2)
   -> Time for fetching the value O(1)
  
  
  
2.Square Root Decomposition:
   -> Time complexity for pre-processing O(n)
   -> Space complexity is O(n)
   -> Time for fetching the value O(root(n))
  

3.Segment Tree:
    -> Bottom Up binary tree approach widely used when huge number of data is present
    -> Time complexity for tree building O(nlogn)
    -> Space complexity is O(nlogn)
    -> Time for fetching the value O(logn)
